# Auth Component

This folder will contain authentication-related React components for your application.  
These components handle user login, registration, logout, and (optionally) password reset and email verification.

## Suggested Components

- **LoginForm.jsx/tsx**: Form for user login.
- **RegisterForm.jsx/tsx**: Form for user registration.
- **LogoutButton.jsx/tsx**: Button to log out the user.
- **AuthProvider.jsx/tsx**: Context/provider for authentication state and logic.
- **ProtectedRoute.jsx/tsx**: Wrapper to protect routes that require authentication.

## Description

- Integrate with Supabase Auth or Firebase Auth for authentication.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Handle authentication state (logged in/out), errors, and loading states.
- Provide hooks or context for accessing the current user throughout the app.
