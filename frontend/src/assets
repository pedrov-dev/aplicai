# Assets

This folder is for static assets such as images, logos, icons, and fonts used in your React frontend.

- Place images (e.g., logo.png), SVGs, and other static files here.
- You can import these assets in your components as needed.

Example usage in a component:
```tsx
import logo from "../assets/logo.png";
```
